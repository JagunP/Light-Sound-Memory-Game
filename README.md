**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Precious-Favour Jagun**

Time spent: **2.5 Hours**

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ - ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ - ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ - ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ - ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ - ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ - ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ - ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ - ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   -->I only used the tutorials/videos provided.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   --> My biggest challenge was with/understanding GitHub. From the YouTube tutorial video, the instructor uses a Mac, which can be tricky
   to translate to a Windows, especially when "home" apps are being used (i.e finder). For example, there was a section where he moved files
   on his desktop, and I wasn't sure if that was something that could be done on my computer or with that much ease. To overcome it, I paused the
   video and tried to understand what exactly he was trying to do outside of the MAC environment (In this case, he was just moving/changing the
   locations of certain files in a specific folder), and once I figured it out, I was able to translate that to my Windows computer. I also had some 
   trouble with just understanding how to upload the gifs/follow the tutorials for uploading the gifs. In this case, i'm not sure if it's a Windows-Mac 
   issue, but to tackle this I just messed around with the tools available and tried different things until something worked.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   --> I am still very much curious about Github and JavaScript. I get the basic idea of Github and how it essentially helps developers collaborate,
   and although I currently don't have questions about it, it is definitely something I want to learn more about. Like how do I collaborate on projects?,
   do I have to work with/know someone to collaborate on a project with them?, Are there security issues present with just having your project that public?,
   can it be hacked into, messed with, e.t.c? (LOL, I guess I do have some questions). I am also pretty intrigued by JavaScript. I took a class once that utilized
   it and I was able to sort of see it in action, but I'm not sure if i'm equipped enought to work on it/using it from scratch, and thats definitely somehting
   I would have questions on.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   --> I would definitely work on the graphics, specifically the colors. It looks good right now, but with more time and a better combination of colors, it could definitely be much better. I would also experiment
   more with the shapes of the buttons and the spacing and placements of stuff, essentially playing around with the HTML and CSS until i'm satisfied with the rsult.
   Once i'm done with the HTML and CSS portion, I would move on to the JavaScript portion. Like I mentioned earlier, i'm still new to JS, so I would probably spend more time studying the code and changing minute details and
   noticing the changes in output just to better understand it, as opposed to implementing new features. However, if I was just an overflowing fountain of JS knowledge, I would try to implement some more interactivity/animations.
   For example, the "Congratualtions, You Won" alert would be a lot more animated and exciting, and I might even include some background noise/images to distract the user and potentially make the game a tad bit harder.
   I would also work on figuring out how to change the text color of my answers.
